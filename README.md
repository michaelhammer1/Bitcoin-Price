## Bitcoin Volatility Prediction

By: Michael Hammer

#Overview: Predicting financial asset price moves using machine learning is difficult given these assets tend to move in a brownian motion type fashion. However, as an options trader, predicting future volatility from past realized volatility should have predictive value and assist volatility firms in making money in the bitcoin options market.

## Goal
Use historical daily abosolute volatility to predict future volatility. Use a LSTM model. Ensure that the model is predictive. Ensure that the model is catching the 'weekend effect' where realized volatility comes off every 7 days.
